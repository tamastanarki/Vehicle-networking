##
## shared memory allocation for this vep
## - the starting addresses are RELATIVE to the start of the shared memory
## - (no need to add 0x800[23]0000)
## - you can use K for 1024 and hex or decimal
## - size & address must use the same format (hex/dec no/K)
## - use /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-size [-A] *.elf
##   to analyse a partition's memory usage
## - it's recommended to use shared/vep.h to manage this memory
##
in mem01 have 1K private memory starting at 0K
in mem02 have 1K private memory starting at 0K
##
## memory and stack allocation for each partition
## - per tile the system application with 32K is always added
## - 8K, 16K, 32K, or 64K per partition
## - max 128K per tile
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 4K stack in 32K memory starting at 32K
on tile 1 partition 1 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 32K
on tile 1 partition 2 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 48K
on tile 1 partition 3 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 64K
on tile 1 partition 4 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 80K
on tile 2 partition 1 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 32K
on tile 2 partition 2 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 48K
on tile 2 partition 3 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 64K
on tile 2 partition 4 has 4K stack in 16K memory starting at 80K
##
## schedule for partitions that have a memory allocation
## - the same length of slot table must be given for all slots
## - max 32 slots per tile
## - a partition can have more than one slot
## - slots are separated by VKERNEL slots of 2000 cycles
## - the system partition uses cycles 0-5000, thus first app slot starts at 7000
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 10000 cycles of 19000 starting at 7000
on tile 1 partition 1 has 50000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 7000
on tile 1 partition 2 has 450000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 59000
on tile 1 partition 1 has 50000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 511000
on tile 1 partition 3 has 450000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 563000
on tile 1 partition 1 has 50000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 1015000
on tile 1 partition 4 has 450000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 1067000
on tile 1 partition 1 has 50000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 1519000
on tile 2 partition 1 has 50000 cycles of 1571000 starting at 7000
